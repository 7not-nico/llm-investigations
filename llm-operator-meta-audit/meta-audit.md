title: Logical Operators vs Semantic Phrasing in LLM Instructions
summary: Cross-region investigation into whether writing instructions with logical operators (&&, ||, XOR, ∩, ⇒, ∈, NOT) instead of declarative semantic phrasing is problematic for LLM instruction following. 189 searches across 13+ regions, 50+ papers from ACL/EMNLP/EACL/AAAI/ICML/ICLR/SemEval 2025-2026. Operator-by-operator evidence, mechanistic analysis, cross-lingual variation, and failure mode taxonomy.

**Core question**: Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `XOR`, `∩`, `⇒`, `∈`, `!`, `¬`) — precision tool or reliability hazard — for LLM instructions, compared declarative semantic phrasing?

**Answer: Reliability hazard, disguise-tool.** Operators save tokens 62–81%. They introduce model-specific, architecture-dependent, language-sensitive failure modes. Semantic phrasing avoids these entirely. Operator fidelity varies across model families > any other instruction format variable. Instruction-tuning degrades operator comprehension in mid-sized models. Semantic phrasing ('X: required', 'apply all constraints') = only reliably cross-lingual, cross-model register.

## Fundamentals

### Core findings

| Finding | Evidence | Confidence |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Simple NL is functional scaffolding, not noise | Scaffolding or Obstacle (Ni, 2026): simple NL structures help attention capture operator relationships | High |
| Operator fidelity is model-specific, not universal | MetaGlyph (van Gassen, 2026): ∩ fails 0-21% across ALL models | High |
| Instruction-tuning destroys operator comprehension | MetaGlyph mid-sized IT models (7-12B): 0% fidelity vs base (3B): 33% | High |
| Operators & semantics use different neural depths | Rocchetti & Ferrara (2026): structural in early layers, semantic in late — they compete | High |
| Imperative register fails cross-lingually | Mason (2026): cooperative in English, competitive in Spanish. Declarative: -81% variance | High |
| Priming is dominant negation failure mode | Semantic Gravity Wells (2026): 87.5% of failures — naming target activates it | High |
| XOR produces correct reasoning + wrong answers | Rao et al. (2026): 100% of depth-7 errors have correct CoT but wrong declared answer | High |
| Connectives are high-entropy fragility points | Park & Lei (ACL 2026): 1 connective change derails 41% of correct chains | High |
| Models lack robust operator grounding | Jiang et al. (ACL 2026): oscillate between structural reasoning and surface matching | High |
| Token reduction is the ONLY proven operator benefit | Tang (2026): no significant CSR improvement (Cliff's δ < 0.01) | High |

### Mechanism underlying operator failures

Logical operators require model context-switch between two processing modes, single forward pass:

1. **Early layers** (0–40%): parse operator syntax → structural constraint mode
2. **Late layers** (60–100%): process semantic meaning → semantic constraint mode

Modes compete for representational resources. Operator addition degrades operator parsing + semantic compliance. This explains:

∩ fails → models interpret ∩ as list punctuation, not conjunction
NOT primes → naming forbidden word activates it in semantic space
XOR dissociates → correct structural reasoning produces wrong semantic output
Instruction-tuning hurts → IT optimizes NL fluency, overwrites operator circuits

## Operator-by-operator evidence

### Conjunction: ∩ / && / AND

| Model | Fidelity | Task type | Source |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| GPT-5.2 Chat | 21.4% | Constraint composition | MetaGlyph |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 2.7% | Constraint composition | MetaGlyph |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | 1.5% | Constraint composition | MetaGlyph |
| Llama 3B | 0% | Constraint composition | MetaGlyph |
| Qwen 7B | 0% | Constraint composition | MetaGlyph |
| OLMo 7B | 0% | Constraint composition | MetaGlyph |
| Gemma 12B | 0% | Constraint composition | MetaGlyph |
| Kimi K2 | 0% | Constraint composition | MetaGlyph |

**Verdict: Use declarative listing for multi-constraint composition.** Models interpret ∩ as list punctuation, not conjunction. Apply declarative listing: 'all constraints required', .satisfy X + Y.

### Implication: ⇒ / →

| Model | Fidelity | Task type | Source |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Kimi K2 | 98.1% | Conditional logic | MetaGlyph |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 33.5% | Conditional logic | MetaGlyph |
| GPT-5.2 Chat | — | Not tested | MetaGlyph |
| All others | 0% | Conditional logic | MetaGlyph |

**Verdict: Model-specific.** Kimi K2 passes. All other models fail. Validate on target model before use.

### Membership: ∈

| Model | Fidelity | Task type | Source |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| GPT-5.2 Chat | 91.3% | Selection | MetaGlyph |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 49.9% | Selection | MetaGlyph |
| Kimi K2 | 36.0% | Selection | MetaGlyph |
| Llama 3B | 33.3% | Selection | MetaGlyph |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | 26.0% | Selection | MetaGlyph |
| Qwen 7B | 20.4% | Selection | MetaGlyph |
| OLMo 7B | 0% | Selection | MetaGlyph |
| Gemma 12B | 0% | Selection | MetaGlyph |

**Verdict: Frontier-model only.** GPT-5.2 achieves good fidelity. Mid-sized IT models score 0%. Use ∈ only for simple selection tasks.

### Negation: NOT / ! / ¬

| Finding | Detail | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Priming rate | 87.5% of failures — naming forbidden word activates it | Semantic Gravity Wells |
| Suppression gap | 4.4× weaker in failures (-5.2pp) vs successes (-22.8pp) | Semantic Gravity Wells |
| Override mode | 12.5% of failures — late-layer FFN overwhelms suppression | Semantic Gravity Wells |
| Chinese negation | Models adopt intuitionist/minimal negation over classical | Li et al., AAAI 2026 |
| Construction mechanism | Mid-layer attention builds ¬Y vector (not just suppresses Y) | Zhou et al., ICML 2026 |

**Verdict: Worst operator choice.** Priming = dominant failure mode. Use 'X: disabled' or 'X: excluded' — declarative register avoids target naming.

### XOR

| Finding | Detail | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Reasoning-output dissociation | 100% of depth-7 errors: correct CoT, wrong answer | Rao et al. |
| Model confidence | 99.99% confident when wrong | Rao et al. |
| Minimum heads | 2 attention heads minimum to compute XOR | LessWrong |
| Trojan operator test | XOR's truth table under novel name matches XOR — problem is logical, not lexical | Rao et al. |

**Verdict: Unreliable in all tested models.** Use explicit enumeration for behavioral constraints.

### Logical connectives (therefore, however, but, so)

| Finding | Detail | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Connective fragility | 41.1% of correct chains derailed by 1 connective change | Park & Lei |
| Relative destructive power | 1.75× more destructive than non-connective perturbations | Park & Lei |
| Token proportion | 4-7% of generated tokens | Park & Lei |
| Repair mechanism | Cross-category transitions drive repairs, not within-category swaps | Park & Lei |

**Verdict: Connectives = single failure points in reasoning chains.** Specify logical relations explicitly. Use explicit logical relations over model-chosen connectives.

### Pseudo-code (IF/ELSE, SWITCH)

| Finding | Detail | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Accuracy gain | +36% over NL | Kryvolapov |
| Token reduction | -87% | Kryvolapov |
| Frontier consensus | 98% across 5 models | SoftPrompt-IR |
| Token reduction (SoftPrompt-IR) | 75-92% | SoftPrompt-IR |

**Verdict: Works on frontier models.** Best operator-adjacent form. Use declarative pseudo-code (IF/ELSE) over raw symbolic notation.

### Steering tokens (learned operator embeddings)

| Finding | Detail | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Compositional accuracy | 62.9% vs 57.4% instructions-only | ACL 2026 Steering Tokens |
| Hybrid gain | Tokens+NL beats either alone | ACL 2026 Steering Tokens |
| Cross-model | Generalizes across 7 models, 5 families | ACL 2026 Steering Tokens |

**Verdict: Promising; requires training.** Learned operators + NL = most effective composition strategy.

## Mechanistic evidence

### Neural depth stratification (Rocchetti & Ferrara 2026)

Nine instruction-following tasks across 3 models (Gemma, Llama, Qwen):

- **Early layers** (<40% depth): encode structural constraints — character count, JSON format, word count, term exclusion
- **Late layers** (>60%): encode semantic constraints — tone, style, topic, sentiment, register
- **No universal mechanism**: task-specific specialist outperforms general probe trained across all tasks
- **Sparse dependencies**: removing one constraint type leaves others unaffected → operators + semantics independent, resource-competition
- **Dynamic monitoring**: constraint satisfaction emerges during generation, not pre-generation planning

### Two-phase attention processing (Attend First, Consolidate Later)

- Bottom layers: gather information from previous tokens >> operator parsing
- Top layers: internal process = semantic consolidation
- Top 1/3: token swaps ignored → model commits to interpretation
- This explains XOR dissociation: early-layer structural parse produces correct result → late-layer semantic consolidation overwrites with wrong answer

### Propositional logic circuits (Hong et al. 2024; Chen et al. 2026)

- 4-stage circuit: rule locate → rule move → fact process → decision
- Middle layers process logical operators (AND/OR) via specialized logical-operator heads
- Stages = sequential + modular → interference at any stage cascades

### Negation circuits (MODELS 2026; Zhou et al., ICML 2026)

> **STATUS: first two bullets REFUTED.** verdict and evidence:
> `granular-investigation/which-model-and-layer-processes-negation.md`
> — the matching paper (arXiv:2605.03052) tests Mistral-7B and Llama-3.1-8B, and
> reports that ablating the shortcut attention *improves* accuracy rather than
> collapsing representations. bullets 3–5 stand.

- ~~Layer 10 :: Gemma-2-27B negation operator~~ **REFUTED**
- ~~Acts as causal trigger → ablating it collapses downstream representations ~40%~~ **REFUTED** (the source reports the opposite sign)
- Construction mechanism dominates: mid-layer attention builds ¬Y representation
- Suppression coexists, weaker
- Late-layer shortcut heads overwrite correct negation → sinking them recovers +17% accuracy

## Failure mode taxonomy

| # | Failure mode | Prevalence | Mechanism | Affected operators | Mitigation |
|---|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Priming | 87.5% of negation failures | Instruction naming target activates rather than suppresses it | NOT, !, ¬ | Declarative phrasing: "X: disabled" |
| 2 | Override | 12.5% of negation failures | Late-layer FFN contributions (+0.39 vs +0.10) overwhelm suppression | NOT, !, ¬ | Post-generation filtering |
| 3 | Reasoning-output dissociation | 100% at depth 7 for XOR | Correct structural reasoning → wrong semantic output | XOR, mixed operators | Avoid XOR; use explicit enumeration |
| 4 | Semantic override | Systematic | Model reverts to pretrained operator defaults despite local redefinition | All operators | Out-of-prompt enforcement; formal verification |
| 5 | Connective fragility | 41.1% of correct chains | Single token change at connective derails trajectory | therefore, however, but | Explicit logical relation specification |
| 6 | Atomic instruction gap | 30.44% accuracy drop | Surface format drives behavior, not logical intent | Symbolic labels (A/B vs 1/2) | Instruction invariance training |
| 7 | Instruction-tuning degradation | 0% vs 33% fidelity | IT optimizes for NL fluency, overwrites operator circuits | All operators on 7-12B models | Hybrid operator+NL; frontier models only |

## Cross-lingual variation

| Language family | Operator behavior | Source |
|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| English | Imperatives cooperate (stacked = coherent authority) | Mason 2026 |
| Spanish | Imperatives compete (stacked = competing obligations) | Mason 2026 |
| French | Imperatives flatten (reduced interaction effects) | Mason 2026 |
| Mandarin | Imperatives partially preserve | Mason 2026 |
| Polish | Fusional morphology aids decoding (#1 in OneRuler long-context) | OneRuler 2026 |
| Russian | Fusional morphology assists but does not improve operator reasoning | OneRuler 2026 |
| Thai | Forced Thai reasoning degrades accuracy. Unconstrained > English-forced > Thai-forced | Typhoon T1 2026 |
| Turkish | English frame load-bearing for reasoning (P=0.67 → 0.12 with Turkish frame) | Turkish logit lens 2026 |
| Japanese | Reverse direction inference varies by word relatedness | Nagata & Ando 2026 |
| Chinese (ZH) | Models adopt intuitionist negation, not classical | Li et al., AAAI 2026 |
| Swahili | Quantifier misinterpretation across languages is bottleneck, not logic | ITLC SemEval-2026 |

**Universal pattern**: English-pivot NL + declarative register = most reliable cross-lingual form. Operator notation parsing: inconsistent across languages, degrades in lower-resource languages.

## Mitigation strategies

| Strategy | Effectiveness | Complexity | Evidence |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Declarative semantic register | High — universal | Low | -81% cross-lingual variance (Mason) |
| Hybrid: operators + NL | High — best accuracy | Low | 62.9% vs 57.4% (ACL Steering Tokens) |
| Pseudo-code IF/ELSE | High — frontier only | Low | +36% accuracy, -87% tokens (Kryvolapov) |
| Structured-output enforcement | High — deterministic | Medium | Preferred over prose (PROT.LLM.SPECIFICATION) |
| FOL parser + theorem prover | High — 95% across 12 langs | High | SemEval-2026 Task 11 |
| Logic-structured RL training | High — transfers to reasoning | Very High | LsrIF: +10.6 arithmetic, +2.7 logic |
| Implicit reasoning graphs | High — complex instructions | High | ImpRIF: SOTA at 32B scale |
| Activation steering | Medium — +11pp | Medium | Logical subspace steering (Fang 2026) |
| Steering tokens (trained) | High — 62.9% compositional | High | ACL 2026 — requires training |

---

## Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| No standardized operator fidelity benchmark | High | Can't compare across studies. Each uses different tasks, models, metrics |
| Unknown operator scaling beyond 1T | Medium | All fidelity data stops at ~1T parameters. Does operator comprehension continue improving? |
| Limited low-resource language coverage | High | Only 1-2 papers per low-resource language. Many language families untested |
| Operator interaction effects | Medium | How do multiple operators compose? Current data only tests one operator at a time |
| Training dynamics of operator circuits | Medium | When during pretraining do operator circuits emerge? When does instruction-tuning overwrite them? |
| Counterfactual operator reasoning | Low | Do models understand operator semantics or just pattern-match from training data? |
